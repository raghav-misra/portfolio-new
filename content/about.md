HeyðŸ‘‹! I'm Raghav, a fullstack engineer and lover of all things web development. Currently, I'm a software engineering intern at [Banqfora](https://www.banqfora.com), and a rising senior at [Amador Valley High School](https://amador.pleasantonusd.net). Outside of work & school, I spend most of my free time ~~writing college essays,~~ participating in hackathons & building side projects (which you're more than welcome to check out [here](/projects)).
