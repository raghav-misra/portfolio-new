HeyðŸ‘‹! I'm Raghav, a fullstack engineer and lover of all things web development. I've committed to study Computer Science at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu) this fall. But right now, I'm a senior graduating this June at [Amador Valley High School](https://amador.pleasantonusd.net). Outside of work & school, I spend most of my free time participating in hackathons & building side projects (which you're more than welcome to check out [here](/projects)).
