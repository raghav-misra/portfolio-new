HeyðŸ‘‹! I'm Raghav, a fullstack developer and lover of all things software engineering. This fall, I'm studying Computer Science at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu). Outside of work & school, I spend most of my free time participating in hackathons & building side projects (which you're more than welcome to check out [here](/projects)).
